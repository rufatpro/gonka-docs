#Gonka

Gonka is a decentralized AI infrastructure designed to optimize computational power specifically for AI model training and inference, offering a competitive alternative to traditional centralized cloud providers. Centralized systems are often expensive, monopolistic, and carry risks of censorship, whereas existing decentralized networks frequently waste resources on non-productive tasks, such as network security.

We introduce an innovative consensus mechanism that ensures nearly **100%** of computational resources are used for meaningful AI tasks, maximizing efficiency and minimizing operational costs. 

The system features key roles: 

- **Developers** build and deploy AI applications using the network’s distributed power. Getting started, visit the [Developer Quickstart Guide](https://gonka.ai/developer/quickstart/).
- **Hosts (hardware providers or nodes)** contribute computational resources to the network and are rewarded based on the amount and quality of resources they provide. To begin contributing, visit the [Host Quickstart Guide](https://gonka.ai/host/quickstart/).

This collaboration allows the platform to offer AI services at significantly lower prices, making advanced AI technology more accessible to a broader audience.
