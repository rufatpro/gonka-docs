# Chat Completions
Learn how to use OpenAI's Core API endpoint to get responses from language models.

## Try GPT-4o
Try out GPT-4o in the playground

To use one of these models via the OpenAI API, you’ll send a request to the Chat Completions API containing the inputs and your API key, and 
receive a response containing the model’s output.

You can experiment with various models in the chat playground. If you’re not sure which model to use then try gpt-4o if you need high 
intelligence or `gpt-4o-mini` if you need the fastest speed and lowest cost.

# Overview
The Chat Completions API supports text and image inputs, and can output text content (including code and JSON).

It accepts inputs via the messages parameter, which is an array of message objects.

## Message roles
Each message object has a role (either system, user, or assistant) and content.

- The system message is optional and can be used to set the behavior of the assistant
- The user messages provide requests or comments for the assistant to respond to
- Assistant messages store previous assistant responses, but can also be written by you to give examples of desired behavior (few-shot examples)

By default, there is no system message. Use system messages to give instructions to the model outside of the user context. You can set multiple 
system messages per conversation, the model will read and interpret messages in the order it receives them.
