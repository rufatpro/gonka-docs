# Developer quickstart

The Name_Placeholder provides a simple interface to state-of-the-art AI models for natural language processing, image generation, 
semantic search, and speech recognition. Follow this guide to learn how to generate human-like responses to natural language prompts,
create vector embeddings for semantic search, and generate images from textual descriptions.

## Create and export an API key
Create an API key in the dashboard here, which you’ll use to securely access the API. Store the key in a safe location, like a .zshrc file or 
another text file on your computer. Once you’ve generated an API key, export it as an environment variable in your terminal.

## Make your first API request
With your Name_Placeholder API key exported as an environment variable, you're ready to make your first API request. You can either use the REST API directly with the HTTP client of your choice, or use one of our official SDKs as shown below.

Execute the code with node example.mjs (or the equivalent command for Deno or Bun). In a few moments, you should see the output of your API 
request!
